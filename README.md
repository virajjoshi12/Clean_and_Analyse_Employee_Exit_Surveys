# Clean_and_Analyse_Employee_Exit_Surveys
In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Institute in Queensland, Australia.

In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to now the following:

Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been here longer?

Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

Below is a preview of a couple of columns we'll work with from the `dete_survey.csv`:

- `ID`: An id used to identify the prticipant of the survey

- `SeparationType`: The reason why the person's employment ended

- `Cease Date`: The year or month the person's employment ended

- `DETE Start Date`: The year the person began employment with the DETE

Below is a preview of a couple of columns we'll work with from the `tafe_survey.csv`:

- `Record ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey

- `Reason for ceasing employment`: The reason why the person's employment ended

- `LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)`: The length of the person's empoyment (in years)
